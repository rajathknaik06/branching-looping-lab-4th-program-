""" Gabriel is working on a wildlife research project where he needs to compute various metrics for different animals based on their characteristics. Each animal type requires a different calculation: a deer’s distance traveled, a bear’s weight based on footprint size, or a bird’s altitude based on its flying pattern. 



Conditions:

For Deer (Mode 'D' or 'd'): Distance = speed of sound * time taken, where the speed of sound in air is 343 meters per second.
For Bear (Mode 'B' or 'b'): Weight = footprint size * average weight, where the average weight per square inch for a bear is 5.0 pounds.
For Bird (Mode 'F' or 'f'): Altitude = flying pattern * distance covered (in meters).


Write a program to help Gabriel analyze the characteristics of animals based on the given inputs.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a character, representing the type of animal 'D/d' for deer, 'B/b' for bear, and 'F/f' for bird.

If the choice is 'D' or 'd':

The second line of input consists of a floating-point value T, representing the time taken from the deer's location to the observer.

If the choice is 'B' or 'b':

The second line of input consists of a floating-point value S, representing the size of the bear's footprint in square inches.

If the choice is 'F' or 'f':

The second line of input consists of a floating-point value P, representing the bird's flying pattern.
The third line consists of a floating-point value D, representing the distance covered by the bird in meters.
Output format :
The output prints one of the following:

If the choice is 'D' or 'd':

The output prints "Distance: X m" where X is a floating point value rounded off to two decimal places, representing the calculated distance traveled by the sound wave in meters.

If the choice is 'B' or 'b':

The output prints "Weight: Y lb" where Y is a floating point value rounded off to two decimal places, representing the estimated weight of the bear in pounds.

If the choice is 'F' or 'f':

The output prints "Altitude: Z m" where Z is a floating point value rounded off to two decimal places, representing the calculated altitude of the bird's flight in meters.

If the given choice is invalid, print "Invalid".
